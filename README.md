## Introduction

This project provides a Python script that allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using different ciphers. The supported ciphers include Caesar cipher, Atbash cipher, and a custom-made cipher.

## Ciphers

### Caesar Cipher

The Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

- To encrypt with Caesar cipher: Choose 'c' -> 'ce'
- To decrypt with Caesar cipher: Choose 'c' -> 'cd'

### Atbash Cipher

The Atbash cipher is a substitution cipher that replaces each letter with its reverse in the alphabet.

- To encrypt with Atbash cipher: Choose 'at' -> 'ae'
- To decrypt with Atbash cipher: Choose 'at' -> 'ad'

### Custom-Made Cipher

The custom-made cipher is a unique encryption and decryption method created for this project.

- To encrypt with custom-made cipher: Choose 'm' -> 'me'
- To decrypt with custom-made cipher: Choose 'm' -> 'md'

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cipher-project.git
   cd cipher-project
   ```
2. Run the script:
  ```bash
  python cipher_script.py
  ```
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to choose the cipher type and perform encryption or decryption.
